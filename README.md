# create-nuxt-django-app

Script that creates a Nuxt Django website.

TODO: get rid of the favicon error msg (configure Django for that), have the pre-built account system have a admin-registers system (current) and a anyone-registers-with-email-code system. Using account stuff means using e-mail stuff, no more distinction.
